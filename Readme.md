# Adventure Game

This project was an assignment for my Object Oriented Programming Class
at University of Central Florida with Professor Nadeem Mohsi.

## The Initial Project

Initially, this assignment was a maze like game where players would
attempt to reach the treasure chest by using the abilities of the three
different units.

Additionally, we were given the option to extend the game for extra credit.

The details of my initial extension are below.

 When you beat the adventure game once, the space game is unlocked.
